# My Fixes

How to import a fix?

The @import line must be at the top and if other imports, grouped together.

@import url(**url here is the one you copy once you click *Here* below**); is the fixes url.

DO NOT REPLACE ANY URLS IN THE FILE, INSTEAD PASTE IT BELOW THE ORIGINAL ONE(S).

The second URL is NOT a replacement as it is just fixes!
> (for example `@import url('https://superdeath.github.io/Fixes/S/SuperImport.css');` <- this is what it would look like 'in-file')
